About us:
Gaon To Ghar is an effort to bring purity, goodness and love of our villages to today's modern homes with people who lost the connect with their roots in pursuit of successful life and employment who actually need products not just for their body but for their souls too.

Our products are directly sourced from the farmers who are practising traditional farming and processing their produce with years old efficient and sustainable methods to retain the quality which is huge on nutrition.

At Gaon To Ghar, we want to help you get back to your roots, our villages, which was all about health, nutrition , love and warmth. We can all get that here without compromising on today's modern lifestyle and being away from our villages.

Why?
Because you deserve the best and pure and also because our farmers need us. Buying from Gaon To Ghar enables us to eliminate middleman, thus providing that profit directly to farmers.

We are not only providing the pure and natural products from the core of our forgotten villages but also empowering the farmers and their families to break the cycle of poverty and building a brighter future. We cut the middleman and get money directly into the hands of our hardworking farmers.

Empowering Women:
Creating jobs for women is especially important for community transformation. Turning women into breadwinners not only builds self-esteem, but improves their standing in the community and enables them to invest in health, nutrition and education for their families.

Our goal is to provide chemical free, traditionally grown and processed products of our villages to reach each of us for better health choices and connecting back to our roots. We also aim at breaking the cycle of extreme poverty by empowering local farmers in villages (of Haryana and Hilly Areas of Uttarakhand) to earn a stable income.
